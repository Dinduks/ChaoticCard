ChaoticCard is a vCard based on the ChaoticSoul theme for Wordpress. 
It built using the micro-framework Silex, Doctrine, Twig template engine, and uses a SQLite database. 

How to use it: 
Place the files somewhere and run index.php/admin 

Things that I'll add soon: 
An admin page to edit the vCard
